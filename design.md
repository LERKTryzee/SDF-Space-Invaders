# Project Overview

The game is a space invaders clone but with updated textures. The theme is Kanye West vs Adidas and Skete.

## Enemy types
The enemies are Skete, Adidas Executive and Kid Cudi. They will have different health and will be harder to kill. They will also do more damage depending on the enemy type.

## New Gameplay
There will be barriers added like the real space invaders that makes it harder to be killed but they will have health and eventually can get destroyed. There will also be lives and if you run out of all the lives you will lose the game. There will also be something you have to protect at the bottom.
